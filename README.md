# Leaf Control for Google Glass

Simple application to start/stop the A/C in my Nissan Leaf from Glass.

Glass port of [Leaf Notification](https://github.com/jaxbot/wear-leafstatus).

It's pretty basic, but allows me to say:

```
Ok glass, control my car, start climate control

Ok glass, control my car, stop climate control
```

Which allows me to get the car cool on my walk to it, without having to use my hands. Fun stuff!
